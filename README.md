## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Michael Kaufman PhD, a Senior Research Scientist at the [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/).

I work as an Bioinformatics Analyst for the [CU Cancer Center](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/colorado-cancer-center) in the [Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Shared Resource (BBSR)](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/bioinformaticssr). Currently, specializing in single-cell RNA-seq analysis and spatial transcriptomics. Previously I was an Informatics Fellow with the RNA Biosciences Initiative (RBI) on campus.

How does bioinformatics help us understand cancer?  
Analyzing high-throughput sequencing data allows us to identify the genes that are expressed in different types of cells and how that changes in cancer. In particular, recent advanced in the capabilities of isolating and sequencing the genes of individual single cells has revolutionized our understanding. My goal as a scientist is to help researchers make sense of their data and ultimately find new ways to treat cancer.

My superpowers are:
 Python :snake: |  R :chart_with_upwards_trend: | Rust :crab: | Bash :shell: | [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) :test_tube: | [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) :snake: | [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) :whale:

I have particular interest in using GitHub for:

- single-cell RNA-seq analysis and visualization
- developing computational methods for spatial transcriptomics
- writing and maintaining reproducible pipelines and analysis workflows
- coding bioinformatics CLI tools and libraries in Python, R, and Rust
- contributing to open-source bioinformatics software
